# Mac stuff that is repetitive and better to automate
The `.scpt` files are compiled applescript.

### List of each script and how to use:

1. `daily_note_template_generator.applescript`
This is being run daily via a "calendar action" it just regenerates a new doc to record daily stuff into.

2. `download_audio_from_video_files.applescript`
This is a quick and dirty way to just take all our "Audio" media objects (they should all be videos that I screen recorded and plan to use the audio from for some reason or another). To move videos here, in photos search for `.mp4` `command + all` photos then move to album `Audio` then just run this script and select the folder you want to export them to.
